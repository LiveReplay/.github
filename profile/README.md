# LiveReplay 
A simple app for a quick replay system.
### How does it work?
The [server](https://github.com/LiveReplay/server) is running on an (let's suppose) the encoding computer. The client apps submit those clips.
For example, a phone client might be configured to send all new clips from the default folder when recording slowmo.
### Which devices are supported?
#### Officially:
 - Android
 - iOS (coming soon, need to get a Mac Mini)
 - A Python client for USB Cameras
 - A Python client for RPI Camera (again, coming soon, need to get a RPI)
#### Unofficialy:
Your client can be here! Drop a issue in the [.github](https://github.com/LiveReplay/.github/issues/new) repository.

PS. I will change this, don't worry.
